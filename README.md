Module 2 Challenge Assignment: Advanced CSS Challenge - Professional Portfolio

Deployed Application: https://dominiquegarrett.github.io/professional-portfolio/


## Description
A developer portfolio is a website that showcases your best work, personality and talents. It is your best chance to prove your skills, share your enthusiasm about the profession and give your potential employers and clients a glimpse of how awesome it would be to work with you. In this web application I have created a professional portfolio to showcase my skills.



# User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
